# Dotfiles

This my own variant of a dotfiles repo. This repo does not install dependencies (I haven't needed to setup machines enough to do this yet), it only documents dependencies and manages shared configuration files.

### Usage
Install (and backup previous) dotfile into  `$HOME` (`~/`) directory :  
```
make link FILE={filename}
```
